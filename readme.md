To get all relevant data about the players and then output it into a [machine readable csv file](https://github.com/miteyan/FantasyPLWebCrawler/blob/master/c.csv)

This can be used for machine learning and data analysis by anyone as this information is not available anywhere else.
The Fantasy Premier League API only gives information of single players in no recognisable format, so this program
loops through each player and picks out the information and outputs it into the table. It also works out the price changes 
per week of the players as that is not available by comparing with previous weeks price for the same player.
